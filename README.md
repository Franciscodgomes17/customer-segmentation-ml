# Customer Segmentation and Targeted Promotions

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** to segment customers based on demographics, purchase history, and behavioral patterns.  
We use **clustering techniques** (KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering) to identify distinct groups of customers, then generate **association rules** to design **personalized marketing strategies**.

Developed as the **Machine Learning II Final Project (NOVA IMS, 2023/2024)**.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **scikit-learn** – clustering (KMeans, Ward linkage, DBScan trials)
- **scipy** – hierarchical clustering, dendrograms
- **mlxtend** – association rules
- **NumPy / Pandas** – data wrangling
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization
- **UMAP** – dimensionality reduction for cluster visualization

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data cleaning (drop irrelevant cols, fix percentages, binary encodings).  
   - Missing values imputation using **KNNImputer**.  
   - Outlier detection (custom thresholds, DBScan).  
   - Feature engineering (education, loyalty, dietary preferences, total spend).  

2. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Methods tested: KMeans, Hierarchical (Ward), DBScan.  
   - Best solution: **Ward with MinMax scaling** → 9 clusters + “Fishy” as a separate 10th.  
   - Final segments:  
     - Promo Hunters  
     - High Spenders  
     - Vegetarians  
     - Pet Lovers  
     - Tech Enthusiasts  
     - Demanding Foodies  
     - Large Families  
     - College Students  
     - Karens  
     - Fishy  

3. **Association Rules & Targeted Promotions**  
   - Market basket analysis (Apriori, support, confidence, lift).  
   - Designed campaigns tailored to each segment (e.g., *Tech & Toast*, *Cooking Essentials*, *Student Drink Bundles*).

## Results & Insights

- Identified **10 unique customer segments** with distinct purchasing patterns.  
- **High Spenders** and **Tech Enthusiasts** concentrated in wealthy urban areas.  
- **Promo Hunters** and **Karens** highly responsive to promotions and discounts.  
- **Vegetarians** and **Fishy** show strong dietary-driven purchasing behaviors.  
- Tailored promotions leverage association rules (e.g., bundle deals, loyalty programs).
